# Ghidra QNX Loader

This plugin adds support for loading executables created by the [Watcom](https://github.com/open-watcom) compiler for QNX 4.

This plugin was developed by loading a number of testcases from a QNX 4 image into IDA and then comparing the output with that of the [wdump](https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2) utility.
There seems to be limited references for this format available so some LMF records are not currently handled (resources, comments).
This also means that both the IDA and Radare2 loaders seem to have different edge cases that are not handled or are incorrect.
Watcom type libraries and signatures are not included in this plugin (IDA has support for them).

The `file` utility included with QNX 4 reports programs as "QNX 400 i286 executable".
